1. Add pointer checking in CircullarIndexString. - Done
2. Remove IndexString if not needed - Done
3. Add UT for 3wayQuickSorting - Done
4. Do a good comparison between different algorithms. - Done
5. Implement exe. - not done. It is quite straight forward.
6. Check the complexity of the algorithm. - Done.
7. Check for general refactoring. - Done.

Running time complexity is almost linearly.

BurrowsWheelerTransform - O( N ( log (N) + 2 ) )
MoveToFront - O( N * R )
Huffman - O ( 2 * N )

Total: O (N ( log (N) + R + 4 )

Further optimizations:
1. Remove a lot of relocations in HuffmanEncoding.
2. Relocation in BurrowsWheeler::encode.
3. Look at another algorithm instead of 3WayRadixQuickSort.

Advantage of point 1 and 2 is around 10%. This could be done, but interfaces will look bad.
